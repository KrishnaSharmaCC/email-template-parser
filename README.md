# email-template-parser
This parser acts like a templating enegine i.e. we can modularize the html components and include them in other html files as required. Once it is fed to the parser, it would generate the final html file which would have:
1. All the included sub components,
2. Inlined styles so as to be supported by all the mail clients
3. Prettified final code.
